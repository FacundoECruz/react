# Altisima's scoreboard

Web application designed for keeping track of card games played with Spanish cards. It was built using React with create-react-app and styled with CSS.

## Features
It allows players to keep track of their score, bet on the number of rounds they will win, and see the results of each round.

The game consists of 9 rounds, and each player receives a predetermined number of cards. Before starting the round, each player bets on how many rounds they will win in total. Once the game is over, the player with the most points wins.
